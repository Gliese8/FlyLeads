*Welcome to FlyLeads!*

FlyLeads is a product that helps Outbound Sales teams, in Travel Agencies, to identify new customer leads, and tailor flight and accommodation options based on their activity on Social Media.

Every day people share on Social Media their desire to go on vacation to country x and city y.
This desire can be seen on people’s posts, comments, and even likes.

With this in mind, we asked ourselves if travel agencies could reach out to these social media accounts and offer them tailored flights and accommodation options. Wouldn’t that increase the likelihood of closing a sale? Well, FlyLeads thinks so.

To do this, we had to:

- Extract people’s activity (posts) on Reddit’s  Subreddits about Travelling via their official API
- Use an ETL Pipeline to extract, prepare and store the results accordingly in an SQLite ddbb.
- Get the destination for each post using NLP Library spaCy for text processing and entity extraction
- Use GoogleMaps API to get geographical data about the destinations people are talking about
- Plot and visualize the top destinations mentioned
- Webscrap Flights and accommodation options from the Google Travel website, to propose to potential client leads.
- As a final output, FlyLeads generates a text file that contains the url of the post to comment on Reddit, and the text content to be used.
